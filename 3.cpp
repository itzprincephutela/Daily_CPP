//inheritence
// pass property from one class to another class 
//base class to derived class
//relation based

//single inheritence: derived class inherit from a single base class.
//     simplest form of inheritance.

//class base{
    //base class members
//};
//class derived : public base {
    //derived class members

//multiple inheritence: derived class inherit from a multiple base class.

//class base1{
    //base class members
//};
//class base2{
    //base class members
//};
//class derived : public base1,public base2 {
    //derived class members
//};

//multilevel inheritence: a class derives from another derived  class,forming a chain of inheritance
